## What is "Jokerini" ?

Jokerini is a [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?l=french) mod that adds various jokers to the game that add a little depth to it.

For now the jokers present in the mod are :

### - Purple Ticket
Scoring with a purple seal card gives a tarot card.<br>
Also has a small chance to be a negative.<br>

### - Iron Factory (no texture yet)
